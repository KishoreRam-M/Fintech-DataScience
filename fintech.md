# 📊 FinTech Data Science — Knowledge Requirements

This document lists the **essential knowledge areas** required to work as a **Data Scientist in the FinTech domain**.
It is structured for **students, freshers, interviews, and real-world application**.

---

## 1. Core Finance Fundamentals

* Simple interest and compound interest
* Loans, EMIs, amortization schedules
* Assets and liabilities
* Cash flow concepts
* Risk vs return
* Basic financial ratios

---

## 2. Banking & Financial Systems

* Retail banking vs corporate banking
* Digital payment systems (cards, UPI, wallets)
* Lending lifecycle (application → approval → repayment → closure)
* Credit bureaus and credit scores
* KYC / KYB fundamentals

---

## 3. FinTech Business Models

* Digital payments
* Lending and Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL)
* Neobanks
* WealthTech platforms
* InsurTech platforms
* Trading and investment platforms

---

## 4. Financial Data Types

* Transactional data
* Time-series data
* Customer behavioral data
* Credit history data
* Market price data
* Event logs and system logs

---

## 5. Statistics (Critical for FinTech)

* Probability distributions
* Mean, median, variance, standard deviation
* Skewness and kurtosis
* Hypothesis testing
* Confidence intervals
* Sampling bias
* Correlation vs causation
* Outlier detection

---

## 6. Machine Learning for FinTech

* Classification (fraud detection, default prediction)
* Regression (credit and risk scoring)
* Anomaly detection
* Time-series forecasting
* Handling imbalanced datasets
* Cost-sensitive learning

---

## 7. Feature Engineering (Most Important Skill)

* Time-based aggregations
* Velocity features
* Frequency and recency features
* Behavioral ratios
* Trend-based features

---

## 8. Model Evaluation Metrics

* Precision
* Recall
* F1-score
* ROC-AUC
* PR-AUC
* Confusion matrix
* Business cost–based evaluation metrics

---

## 9. Fraud & Risk Concepts

* Common fraud patterns
* Adversarial behavior
* Concept drift
* False positive vs false negative trade-offs
* Rule-based and ML hybrid systems

---

## 10. Explainability & Interpretability

* Feature importance
* Model transparency
* Reason codes
* Trust, auditability, and traceability

> Explainability is **mandatory** in financial systems.

---

## 11. Regulations & Compliance (Awareness Level)

* Data privacy fundamentals
* Financial regulation mindset
* Audit requirements
* Fairness and bias awareness

---

## 12. Data Engineering Basics

* Data pipelines
* Batch vs real-time processing
* Logging and monitoring
* Data quality checks

---

## 13. Experimentation & Decision Science

* A/B testing
* Threshold tuning
* Risk cutoffs
* Business trade-offs

---

## 14. Tools & Ecosystem (Conceptual Knowledge)

* SQL
* Python
* Pandas and NumPy
* Machine learning libraries
* Data visualization tools

---

## Core Mental Model

```
Finance Problem
      ↓
Risk Understanding
      ↓
Statistical Reasoning
      ↓
Machine Learning Model
      ↓
Explainable Decision
```

If any layer is weak, the **FinTech system fails**.

---

## What You Do NOT Need Initially

* Advanced derivatives pricing
* Complex quantitative trading strategies
* Hardcore financial mathematics

---

## Summary

* FinTech Data Science = Finance + Data + Risk
* Statistics and feature engineering matter more than algorithms
* Explainability is non-negotiable
* Business cost matters more than raw accuracy
