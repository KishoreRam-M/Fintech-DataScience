 📊 Shape — How Is the Data Distributed?

**Shape** means:
👉 *When you draw the data as a graph (like a histogram), what does it look like?*

Does the data:

* Look **balanced**?
* Or is it **pulled more to one side**?

---

## ⚖️ Symmetric Shape (Balanced Data)

* The left side and right side of the graph look **almost the same**.
* Most values are in the **middle**.
* Values decrease evenly on both sides (like a bell shape).

### What this means

* **Mean ≈ Median ≈ Mode**
* Any of them can represent the “typical” value.

### Easy example

* Exam marks where most students score around the average.
* Very high and very low marks are equally rare.

---

## ➡️ Skewed Shape (Not Balanced)

Here, the data is **stretched more on one side**, creating a **long tail**.

---

### 🔹 Right-Skewed (Positive Skew)

* Long tail on the **right side**.
* Most values are **small or medium**.
* A few **very large values** pull the average up.

**Mean > Median**

**Example**

* People’s income:
  Most people earn less, a few earn very high salaries.

---

### 🔹 Left-Skewed (Negative Skew)

* Long tail on the **left side**.
* Most values are **high**.
* A few **very small values** pull the average down.

**Mean < Median**

**Example**

* Age at retirement:
  Most people retire around 60, but a few retire very early.

---

## 🤔 Why Shape Matters

* Many statistical methods **assume balanced (symmetric) data**.
* If data is highly skewed:

  * A simple average can be **misleading**.
  * Some models may give **wrong results**.

### What we do then

* Use **median instead of mean**, or
* **Transform the data** (log, square root), or
* Use **special models or tests** that don’t need symmetry.

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways

* **Check the shape before trusting the average.**
* Symmetric data → mean is reliable.
* Skewed data → median is safer.
* Shape helps choose the **right method** and **right model**.
